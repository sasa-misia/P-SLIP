# P-SLIP
P-SLIP is a complete, fast, and modern Landslide Susceptibility Tool entirely built in Python.

Several operations and models can be generated, in order to forecast landslides.

This is an enanched version of the M-SLIP project, and it is under development, so any help by the community is highly appreciated.

Do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested in this project!

I am working to provide you with detailed documentation, but in the meantime you can check M-SLIP (https://github.com/sasa-misia/M-SLIP.git).

Thank you for your understanding, and best regards ✌️
